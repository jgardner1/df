TODO/NOTES

* Maps with depth. Moving up and down either with the scroll wheel, a key
combo plus mouse motion vertically, or the same key combo and up/down.

I'd like to have a depth test. Draw the next 4 levels, using a fog so that the
4th level is very, very dim. Perhaps even get some perspective going? What
should the fog color be?

Or perhaps I can do an overlay of colored tiles that are transparent. These
will be colored based on the light in the cell below. This might give a cheap
volumetric feeling. It could also be for the topmost layer. Perhaps the open
cell above keeps track of the light level below and draws a transparent layer?

Moving up/down should "peel" away the top layer or stick it back on? Some kind
of animation seems important.

* Saving maps. Store the maps in a file. File format: JSON? Or maybe pickle
format. When I move to C, I can write a script to convert from pickle to C's
format. cPickle may or may not be faster than JSON.
